# Update Documentation

1. Run `.claude/scripts/get_staged_updates.sh` to get staged files and diff
2. Analyze the output — identify any user-facing functionality changes
3. Check README.md and related docs for accuracy against those changes
4. Only update docs where content would be inaccurate or missing
5. Do NOT document refactors, test changes, or internal details
6. Report what changed and why, or confirm no update was needed
